Some pages include clickable email addresses (mailto: links). By default they open in a mail application like Outlook Express. This Chrome extension makes sure they open in Gmail instead (if you don't see the point, take a look at [craigslist](http://santabarbara.craigslist.org/sub/)).

It is a modification of the original Google extension [Send from Gmail][1], but it won't add any extra button to the minimalistic Chrome toolbar. It also sportss a couple of bugfixes and safety features. See the [extension gallery page][2] for the changelog.

Less is more!
