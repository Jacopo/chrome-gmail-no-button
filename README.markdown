Some pages include clickable email addresses (mailto: links). By default they open in a mail application like Outlook Express. This Chrome extension makes sure they open in Gmail instead (if you don't see the point, take a look at [craigslist](http://santabarbara.craigslist.org/sub/)).

It is a modification of the original Google extension [Send from Gmail][1], but it won't add any extra button to the minimalistic Chrome toolbar. Besides a couple of bugfixes, it adds the ability to open links in a new window. See the [extension gallery page][2] for the changelog.

The 'Email this page' feature is optionally available from the right-click menu.
